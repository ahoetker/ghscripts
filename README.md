# ghscripts
A collection of \*NIX scripts I use frequently.

## Requirements

### Python

Python version 3.6.x is required.

A **requirements.txt** file is maintained to allow easy installation of
additional modules. The modules do not have any version requirements, the
latest version will be installed.

Usage: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
